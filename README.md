# Sentiment analysis
Analysis of research pappers


NLP has seen significant advancements in recent years and one of the most exciting areas of reseach within NLP is sentiment analysis.It is a technique used to determine and classify the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text. 
Sentiment analysis helps in business insights, social media monitoring, market research ,costumer support etc.


2 key research areas:


1)Fine-Grained sentiment analysis:
It focuses on three polarities(positive,negative and neutral).


2)Cross-lingual Analysis:
Language barriers should not resist the ability to analyze sentiment.It aims to develop models that work across multiple languages
The deep learning models techniques like RNN,CNN and transformer models like BERT and GPT have helped sentiment analysis to achieve great results.
But still ,sentiment analysis faces several challenges.Sarcasm and Irony detections and cultural and contextual variatons are some examples. 



Process:



1) Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, removing stopwords and syeaming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
2) Feature extraction: revelent features are extracted from the preprocessed text.Bag of Words,TF-IDF and word embeddings are examples
3) Model building:ML models like SVM,Naive Bayes,or deep learning models like RNN or CNN  and transformer models are trained on labeled dataset.
4) Models are evaluted using accuracy,F1-score etc.
